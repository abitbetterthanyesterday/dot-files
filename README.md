# Dot-files

A collection of my dotfiles.
After years of avoiding it, the time has come to gather my stuff together and stop re-doing the whole setup every time I jump on a new machine.

## Script installation

Just for fun, and playing with `ink`, I am writing a simple CLI to make it interactive.

Note that this is WIP!
